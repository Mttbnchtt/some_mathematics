\chapter*{Preface}
I solve some exercises and prove some statements taken from Cauchy's Course d'analyse (1821).

\section*{Notation}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\bigwedge S$ is the least element in the set $S$ (which I assume to be non-empty and strictly ordered).
    \item $\bigvee S$ is the greatest element in the set $S$ (which I assume to be non-empty and strictly ordered).
\end{enumerate}
 
\chapter{Pr\`{e}liminaries}
In the chapter \textit{Pr\`{e}liminaries}, Cauchy discusses the general notion of quantity. He states the following definition and two propositions:

\bigskip

\begin{definition}
    Let $n\in \N$. Given a list of real numbers\footnote{
    ~Cauchy speaks of ``quantities'' (\textit{quantit\'{e}}). I do not claim that Cauchy's quantities coincide exactly with the real numbers.
    }
    $a_1,\ a_2,\ \dots,\ a_n$, a real number $m$ is \textit{medium} (\textit{moyenne}) among the $a_1,\ \dots,\ a_n$ if and only if
    \[
        \bigwedge \{a_1,\ a_2,\ \dots,\ a_n\} \leq m \leq \bigvee \{a_1,\ a_2,\ \dots,\ a_n\}.
    \]
\end{definition}

\bigskip

\begin{theorem}\label{theorem.medium}
Let $n\in \N$. Let $(a_i)_{1\leq i \leq n}$ and $(b_i)_{1\leq i \leq n}$ be sequences of real numbers. Then,
\[
    \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_1}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i}
\]
is a medium of  
\[
    \frac{a_1}{b_1},\ \dots,\ \frac{a_n}{b_n}.
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $a_1,\ a_2,\ \dots,\ a_n$ be real numbers. Therefore, 
    \[
        \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i}{n}
    \]
    is a medium of $a_1,\ a_2,\ \dots,\ a_n$ and $b_1,\ \dots,\ b_n$ where $b_i = 1$ (and it is called the \textit{arithmetic medium}).
\end{theorem}
One proof (using \cref{theorem.medium}) is the following.
\begin{proof}
    Apply \cref{theorem.medium}.
\end{proof}

The following is a different proof of \cref{theorem.medium} that does not rely on \cref{theorem.medium}.
\begin{proof}
    Let $a = \bigwedge\left\{a_1,\ \dots,\ a_n\right\}$ and $A = \bigvee \left\{a_1,\ \dots,\ a_n\right\}$. Moreover, let $m = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i}{n}$. I have to show that 
    \[
        a \leq  m \leq A .
    \]
    
    First, I prove that $a \leq m$. Since $a = \bigwedge\left\{a_1,\ \dots,\ a_n\right\}$, for some $k_1,\ \dots,\ k_n$, one can rewrite the sequence $a_1,\ \dots,\ a_n$ as 
    \[
        a+k_1,\ \dots,\ a+k_n.
    \]

    Therefore,
    \begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
        a   & =     & \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} a}{n} \nonumber \\
            & \leq  & \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} a}{n} + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} k_i}{n} \nonumber \\
            & =     & \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (a+k_1)}{n} \nonumber \\
            & =     & \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i}{n} \nonumber \\
            & =     & m. \nonumber
    \end{IEEEeqnarray}

    Now, I show that $m\leq A$. Similarly to in the previous case, since $A = \bigvee \left\{a_1,\ \dots,\ a_n\right\}$, for some $k_1,\ \dots,\ k_n$, one can rewrite $a_1,\ \dots,\ a_n$ as 
    \[
        A-k_1,\ \dots,\ A-k_n.
    \]
    Reasoning as above, one shows that 
    \[
        m = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i}{n} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (A-k_1)}{n} \leq \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} A}{n} = A.
    \]
\end{proof}
When $b_i = 1$ for all $1\leq i \leq n$, I will simply say that 
\[
    \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i}{n}
\] 
is the \textit{arithmetic mean} of $a_1,\ \dots,\ a_n$ (i.e., I will not mention the $b_i$'s).
